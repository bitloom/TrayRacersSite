      The world endedâ€¦But the fun didnâ€™t! Race your pals across the adorable post-apocalyptic world of Tray Racers! Grab a tray, surf the dunes, and get ready to SLIDE, DRIFT and TRICK your way to the finish line in this cute &amp; colorful party racer, built for online multiplayer! YAHOOOOOO! 
      
      Every race takes place on a unique, randomly-generated track - with weird and wonderful vistas, hazards, creatures, and surprises from a mix of bizarre &amp; beautiful post-apocalyptic biomes.
